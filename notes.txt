Starting datasets are located in data.
Seperated all-viral.fa operates as complete working data set with test folder holds each seperated fna file.
Duo indexDriver.py and Index handles origianl seperation and old sorting algorithm.
Work backbone is conducted by mashOutput.py interacts with already seperated files in the folder and compares their mash distances by sequential size in a list determined by bubble sort.
Output.txt is parsed by outputSort.py which eliminates all zero results by taking in Output.txt that mashOutput puts out, removes the zeros and sorts in descending order in alikeness.
sortedOutput.txt holds all 700ish pairs found to be similiar even at the most basic level.
3 Pairs were chosen from highest alikeness to evaluate under ANI and AAI. With 1 control measured as 0 alikeness to verify authenticity.
3 Pair Codes
030911 | 030927 | Mash Alikeness : 995/1000
034266 | 024450 | Mash Alikeness : 856/1000
022981 | 021311 | Mash Alikeness : 748/1000
Control Pair
009559 | 032275 | Mash Alikeness : 0/1000
